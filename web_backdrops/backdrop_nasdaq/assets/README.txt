Place your background reference image here as:

  background.jpg

It will be used as the full-bleed backdrop in index.html. If it’s missing,
the page will fall back to a gradient background.

Also place the center logo as:

  nasdaq-2008-logo.svg

SVG is preferred for crisp scaling. If this file is missing,
the page will show a text fallback that says “Nasdaq”.
